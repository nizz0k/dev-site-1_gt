					GreenTec Capital Partners invests in African start-ups and SMEs with a focus on combining social and environmental impact with financial success. Jointly, we seek to develop impactful and sustainable local solutions that have international growth perspective and contribute to the UNâ€™s Sustainable Development Goals. We do more than just invest: We provide custom-tailored support to develop innovative companies and guide them through start-up funding gaps and early crucial phases. Our support includes capacity building, business model optimization, as well as funding. This approach provides investors with the opportunity to participate in the development of companies at different stages and risk-return profiles. By 2020, we plan to increase our portfolio to 50 companies. In 2017, we were awarded the German Development Award by the Carl Duisberg Gesellschaft (CDG) and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). Joining forces with GreenTec Capital, our investees become competitive on an international stage, many of whom have already been recognized by international fellowships, awards, and the media.
